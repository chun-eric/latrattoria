## La Trattoria - A High End Italian Fine Dining Restaurant

La Trattoria is a website I built based on one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Osaka. The food and customer service is top so I wanted to build a website that showcased this. Everything was built from scratch with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and no frameworks. The design was based on many other inspirational restaurant designs I reasearched online. I used Claude AI for my AI assistant and a lot of Googling for a lot of debugging issues when I got really stuck. Making this website, was a lot of work and really pushed my CSS and JavaScript skills.

<h5>Challenges:</h5>
There were many challenges throughout this project that had to solved but the main big challenges were:

<br>
<br>

1. How do I position the hero picture to be the main background and make the navbar sit ontop while also allowing it zoom infinitely in and out?
   <br>

2. How do I create an automatic and also manual photo slider carousel that is also mobile responsiveness and shrinks proportionally to the screen size?
   <br>

3. How do I create a menu filtering system that is smooth and fast?
   <br>

4. How do I create hovering up and down animation on shapes in pure CSS?
   <br>

5. How do I get the active button on the slider to match the correct the index of the photo in the slider and transition accordingly?
   <br>

6. How do I get the Gallery carousel to be an automatic slider but automaticaly stops and allows it be manually controlled/grabbed to allow for manual sliding?
   <br>

7. How do I get the Gallery carousel to be mobile responsive?
   <br>

8. How to add a loader after a valid input has been submitted?
   <br>

9. How do we ensure that a click event only occurs on the arrow and not the icon in the reservation form?
   <br>

10. How do we get the parent container to receive a border color only when we click on the arrow dropdown in the reservation form?
    <br>

11. How do you make elements enter the webpage sequentially in a smooth transition upon loading the initial website.
    <br>

12. How can I speed up photo loading times?

  <br>
  
13. If I wanted to stretch this project even more, what are some other features I could consider adding?
 
  <br>

I also spent a significant amount of time designing website. The process could have been sped up by designing everything in Figma first.
